Echo Client and Server with Logging
This repository contains two Python scripts:

echo-client.py: This script simulates a client that connects to a server and sends data periodically. The client sends a predefined message to the server and waits for a response. If the response matches a specific string, it sends a measurement data packet to the server.

server_logging_store_data.py: This script acts as a server that listens for incoming connections from clients. Upon connection, it sends a specific message to the client and waits to receive data. Once data is received, it logs the data along with a timestamp into separate text files for each client.

Usage
To use these scripts, follow the instructions below:
